Hi!

In this project I created an arduino robot that can move around, and can be controlled via bluetooth low energy connection from my laptop that is hosting a webserver and website, such that anyone can go to that website to control my robot. This still has some issues at the moment but it run as an initial proof of concept! I will update the files as I make more progress on this project.
